# Task-2-Movie-Rating-Prediction

CodSoft Task 2 = "Movie Rating Prediction Using Python". Predict accurate movie ratings using linear regression. The project aims to help users make informed decisions and find movies they really like. Here are some key highlights:

Data collection: We curated a comprehensive dataset of movie attributes such as genre, director, cast, and release year, and collected ratings and reviews from kaggle.
Data preprocessing: Data were thoroughly cleaned and preprocessed, missing values ​​were treated, categorical features were encoded, and numerical attributes were normalized. 
Linear regression modeling: Build a predictive model that analyzes the relationship between movie features and ratings, selects relevant features, and iteratively refines the model.
